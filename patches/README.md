# Patches To Kernel 5.10.1
## Description
This directory includes two patches (`bpf.patch` and `verifier.patch`). These patches raise the limits of the maximum BPF program size (`bpf.patch`) and max jump sequences (`verifier.patch`). I made these patches with Linux kernel 5.10.1 which can be found [here](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/). 

A good guide on compiling your own Linux kernel into `.deb` files can be found [here](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/custom-compiled-kernel-debian-ubuntu/). You can then install the kernel via `dpkg -i *.deb` after finished. Additionally, I found the command `make bindeb-pkg -j <core count>` to be useful if you're recompiling the kernel after the first time since `make deb-pkg -j <core count>` performs `make clean` which results in the building process taking a lot longer. 

Sadly, the XDP Forwarding program will not work without these modifications to the Linux kernel since I was running into limitations no matter what I tried. I believe these limitations were put in-place to avoid long unoptimized BPF programs from being loaded into the kernel and impacting system performance. However, this program should not impact performance in this case.
